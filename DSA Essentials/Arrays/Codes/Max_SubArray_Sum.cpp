/* Problem Statement:
Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.
A subarray is a contiguous part of an array.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1]
Output: 1
Example 3:

Input: nums = [5,4,-1,7,8]
Output: 23

Solution:
=> Brute Force: Use three loops to keep track of max sum amongst all subarrays. [O(N^3)]

=> Best Approach: KADANE's ALGORITHM
1.
